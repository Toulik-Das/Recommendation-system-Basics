## Types of Recommendations
In this lesson, I worked with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:

  - Knowledge Based Recommendations</br>
  - Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
  - Content Based Recommendations
  
Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:

 - Model Based Collaborative Filtering
 - Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering

## Similarity Metrics
In order to implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, you will learn about some common ways to measure the similarity between two users (or two items) including:

 - Pearson's correlation coefficient
 - Spearman's correlation coefficient
 - Kendall's Tau
 - Euclidean Distance
 - Manhattan Distance

## Business Cases For Recommendations
Four ideas needed for businesses to implement successful recommendations to drive revenue, which include:

`Relevance
Novelty
Serendipity
Increased Diversity`
At the end of this lesson, you will have gained a ton of skills to build upon or to start creating your own recommendations in practice.
